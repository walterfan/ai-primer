1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
our relationships, but there are also some big problems like Central America, where with

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,280
a relatively modest investment, we could really be making a difference and making ourselves

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
safer.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
So there's been this idea of a pivot to Asia.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
And what does that mean to you in specific terms?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,760
A transfer of hard military resources, a transfer of sort of time on your agenda in the National

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
Security Council.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,080
Is it something you've really managed to pull off, or does the Middle East really still

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,640
have us kind of sucked in?

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
I think it means all the above.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,400
Look, Asia is the fastest growing region in the world, the most populous region in the

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:48,760
world, and you've got the largest country in the world, China, that has undergone this

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,960
incredible dramatic.
