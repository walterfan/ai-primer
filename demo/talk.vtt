00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
our relationships, but there are also some big problems like Central America, where with

00:06.560 --> 00:12.280
a relatively modest investment, we could really be making a difference and making ourselves

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
safer.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.560
So there's been this idea of a pivot to Asia.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.680
And what does that mean to you in specific terms?

00:19.680 --> 00:25.760
A transfer of hard military resources, a transfer of sort of time on your agenda in the National

00:25.760 --> 00:27.160
Security Council.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.080
Is it something you've really managed to pull off, or does the Middle East really still

00:31.080 --> 00:32.640
have us kind of sucked in?

00:32.640 --> 00:35.200
I think it means all the above.

00:35.200 --> 00:39.400
Look, Asia is the fastest growing region in the world, the most populous region in the

00:39.400 --> 00:48.760
world, and you've got the largest country in the world, China, that has undergone this

00:48.760 --> 00:49.960
incredible dramatic.
